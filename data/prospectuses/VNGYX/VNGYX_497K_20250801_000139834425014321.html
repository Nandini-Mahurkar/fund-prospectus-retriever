<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The Board of Trustees of the Trust, at the recommendation
of Vontobel Asset Management, Inc. (the &ldquo;Adviser&rdquo;), the investment adviser of the Fund, has approved a plan of liquidation
providing for the liquidation of the Fund&rsquo;s assets and the distribution of the net proceeds <I>pro rata</I> to the Fund&rsquo;s
shareholders. In connection therewith, the Fund is closed to investments from new and existing shareholders effective immediately. The
Fund is expected to cease operations and liquidate on or about August 29, 2025 (the &ldquo;Liquidation Date&rdquo;). The Liquidation Date
may be changed without notice at the discretion of the Trust&rsquo;s officers.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">Prior to the Liquidation Date, shareholders may redeem
(sell) their shares in the manner described in the &ldquo;Purchasing, Selling and Exchanging Fund Shares &ndash; How to Sell Your Fund
Shares&rdquo; section of the Prospectus. For those Fund shareholders that do not redeem (sell) their shares prior to the Liquidation Date,
the Fund will distribute to each such shareholder, on or promptly after the Liquidation Date, a liquidating cash distribution equal in
value to the shareholder&rsquo;s interest in the net assets of the Fund as of the Liquidation Date.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">In anticipation of the liquidation of the Fund, the
Adviser may manage the Fund in a manner intended to facilitate the Fund&rsquo;s orderly liquidation, such as by holding cash or making
investments in other highly liquid assets. As a result, during this time, all or a portion of the Fund may not be invested in a manner
consistent with its stated investment strategies, which may prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective.</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">&nbsp;</P>

<P STYLE="font: 11pt Times New Roman, Times, Serif; margin: 0; text-align: justify">The liquidation distribution amount will include any
accrued income and capital gains, will be treated as a payment in exchange for shares and will generally be a taxable event for shareholders
investing through taxable accounts. You should consult your personal tax advisor concerning your particular tax situation. Shareholders
remaining in the Fund on the Liquidation Date will not be charged any transaction fees by the Fund. However, the net asset value of the
Fund on the Liquidation Date will reflect costs of liquidating the Fund. Shareholders will receive liquidation proceeds as soon as practicable
after the Liquidation Date.</P>
